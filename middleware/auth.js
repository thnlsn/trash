// Middleware is just a function that has access to the req & res cycle and req & res object whenever we hit any endpoint
// So whenever an endpoint is hit, we can fire off the middleware

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const config = require('config');

// This is the middleware function
module.exports = function(req, res, next) {
    // Get token from header
    const token = req.header('x-auth-token'); // 'x-auth-token' is the key to the token in the header
    // Check if there is NOT a token
    if (!token) {
        return res.status(401).json({ msg: 'No token, authorization denied' }); // This only pertains to protected routes
    }

    // If there IS a token
    try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.jwtSecret); // verify takes in the token and the secret from config
        // at this point decoded is the entire jwt (alg, type, iat, exp, and the user object with mongo id we signed in the routes)

        req.user = decoded.user; // set req.user to the user in the jwt payload *so that we have access to user in the route*
        next(); // move on
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(401).json({ msg: 'Token is not valid' }); // if it doesn't verify, send msg
    }
};

// Summary:
// This file will activate on protected routes
// It gets the token which should have been signed in the route
// If there isnt a token, access is denied
// If there is, create a variable that is the entire jwt object WITH the users ID
// then set the req.user object to the jwt user object
// If the token doesnt verify, deny the action
